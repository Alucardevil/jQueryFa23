      <p>In simple terms, jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with HTML documents, manipulate webpage elements, and add interactivity to web pages. It simplifies common tasks that developers often need to perform, such as selecting HTML elements, handling events (like clicks or mouse movements), and making AJAX requests to fetch data from a server without reloading the entire page.

        jQuery provides a set of functions and methods that allow you to write less code and achieve more in web development. It's especially useful for tasks like animations, form validation, and DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation, making it a popular choice for web developers to create dynamic and responsive websites with less effort.
        
        To use jQuery in an HTML document, you typically include the jQuery library by adding a script tag to your HTML file. Once included, you can write JavaScript code using jQuery functions to enhance the behavior and functionality of your webpage.</p>
